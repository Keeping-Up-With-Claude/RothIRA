Looking at the final results:
Baseline (no conversions): $3.68M final assets, $1.47M lifetime taxes
With conversions: $4.55M final Roth assets, $1.51M lifetime taxes
The key insight is that despite paying slightly MORE in total lifetime taxes ($1.51M vs $1.47M), they end up with $870K MORE in final assets. Here's why:

Tax-free growth dominates: The $1.73M converted grows tax-free for decades. Even though they pay ~$78K/year in taxes during conversion years, that converted money compounds at 7% without any future tax drag.
Avoiding the RMD tax spike: Without conversions, when Chris hits age 73, large RMDs force income well into the 32%+ brackets. With conversions, the Traditional IRA is depleted before RMDs begin, so they avoid those high-bracket forced distributions.
Lower taxation of Social Security: Smaller Traditional IRA balances mean lower RMDs, which means less of their Social Security gets taxed (up to 85% can be taxable based on provisional income).
More years of compounding: Money moved to Roth in 2026-2033 gets 20-30+ years of tax-free growth versus staying in Traditional and being forced out via RMDs at higher tax rates.

The slightly higher total taxes paid are essentially an "investment" that unlocks decades of tax-free compounding. It's classic tax arbitrage: pay 24% now to avoid 32%+ later, while gaining tax-free growth.
